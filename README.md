# Predicting-Used-Car-Prices-using-Machine-Learning-with-Deployment
The focus of this project is developing machine learning models that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features, in order to make informed purchases. We implement and evaluate various learning methods on a dataset consisting of the sale prices of different makes and models across cities in the United States and deploy it using Flask.
